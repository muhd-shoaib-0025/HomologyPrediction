# Using Positional Embedding and Transformer-based Siamese Neural Network to Predict Genetic Homologues for Future Protein Structure Prediction
The accurate prediction of transcriptome homologues can plays a crucial role in protein structure prediction and related fields. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages a Siamese neural network with positional embedding and a Transformer based architecture to predict transcriptome homologues. The positional embedding captures positional dependencies in the mRNA sequences, while the Transformer based architecture enables the network to learn informative representations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately detecting transcriptome homologues, showcasing its potential for enhancing protein structure prediction and related applications. Notably, the model achieved an impressive 60.29\% correct predictions at transcriptome level. This exceptional accuracy reflects the model's ability to effectively discriminate between homologous and non-homologous mRNA sequences. When cross-referenced the predicted transcriptome homologues with PSI-BLAST results, we achieved a modest score of 21.58\% correct predictions.
